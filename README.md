# FSRS Swift Dataset

The original dataset is hosted on [Networks-Learning/spaced-selection](https://github.com/Networks-Learning/spaced-selection).

This repository contains the code to extract reviews from the dataset, group them by user, and save them to parquet files.

The parquet files can be used for [srs-benchmark](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/srs-benchmark).
